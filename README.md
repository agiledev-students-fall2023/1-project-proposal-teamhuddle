# Project Huddle

Huddle would be a web-app that connects people looking for teammates or practice partners for a specific sport. This app looks to solve the problem of missing enough members to play a game of basketball, baseball, soccer, etc.

# For whom?
This app is targeted towards those who engage in various sports or even those who are just passionate about a single sport. It can also be useful for beginners that are looking for other players near their skill level. Everyone who uses this app can find themselves improving in their favorite pastime.

# How?
The user will create their account listing their own ratings of their skills in the sport(s) that they are interested in. Then the user will search for other players filterd by specific sport. After playing a game with each other, the users can rate each others skill levels or simply just add a game to their growing records for others to see. The user would be able to add comments under other users profile and photos/vidoes of the match they played. The web-app would show users players with similar ratings/skill levels. 

# Scope
This proposal is not too easy for a group of 4-6 to complete since there will be an adequate number of features to implement. There will need to be web pages for user login, user profile, sports section and search page. Database will be needed to store user login info, user data, comments, images, ratings, and match history. There will also need to be an algorithm for users to find players near them and also with skills similar to their own. Each sport also has different skills connected to it so the page of ratings for players in different sports will be distinct. While there will be many tasks to do, none of the tasks will be near impossible to complete.
